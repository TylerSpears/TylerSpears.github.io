# Research

## EPINR ‑ Distortion Correction in Clinically‑Constrained Echo Planar MRIs with INR‑Based Registration 
**University of Virginia**

_Ongoing_

- Correction of magnetic susceptibility distortion in EPIs (BOLD/fMRI and DWI/dMRI) without fieldmaps or reverse phase‑encoded acquisitions.
- Uses implicit neural representations (INRs) to learn physically‑plausible deformation fields from T1w MRIs to distorted EPIs.

## MedIL ‑ Medical images from Implicit Latent spaces

**University of Virginia**

_2024 ‑ 2025_
- A first‑of‑its‑kind autoencoder that encodes medical images at their native resolution, without resampling, using implicit neural representations.
- Used alongside diffusion generative models to generate medical images of any resolution.
- Demonstrated exceptional or competitive performance versus previous methods on both T1w brain MRIs and lung CTs.

## Diffusion MRI features for predicting progression of multiple sclerosis 

**University of Virginia**

_Ongoing_
- Collaboration with Dr. Myla Goldman M.D. at Virginia Commonwealth University Department of Neurology.
- Studied image features in MS patient diffusion MRIs that correspond with progression or non‑progression of MS symptoms.
- Found that extra‑cellular content in MS lesions corresponds to patient performance in a six minute walk diagnostic test.

## FENRI ‑ Fiber orientations from Explicit Neural RepresentatIons 

**University of Virginia**

_2023 ‑ 2025_
- A novel spatially‑continuous super‑resolution neural network to improve white matter tractography in clinical‑grade diffusion MRIs.
- Outperforms current methods in resolution enhancement of in vivo noisy, low‑resolution diffusion MRIs.
- Beats other methods at recovering white matter tracts from low‑resolution simulated diffusion images.
