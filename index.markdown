I am a current PhD candidate and researcher at the University of Virginia, researching how we can use machine learning to improve neuroimaging and better understand the brain. My interdisciplinary research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and biomedical
engineering, where I combine traditional and cutting‑edge image processing methods to allow medical professionals see clinical data with a new
clarity. I am also passionate about teaching and mentoring the upcoming generation of scientists and engineers, and ensuring my work helps
people in resource‑constrained situations.
