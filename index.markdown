# Welcome
![Tyler at Shenandoah National Park](/assets/images/Tyler Shenandoah.JPG)

I am a current PhD candidate and researcher at the University of Virginia, researching how we can use machine learning to improve neuroimag‑
ing and better understand the brain. My interdisciplinary research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and biomedical
engineering, where I combine traditional and cutting‑edge image processing methods to allow medical professionals see clinical data with a new
clarity. I am also passionate about teaching and mentoring the upcoming generation of scientists and engineers, and ensuring my work helps
people in resource‑constrained situations.

## Work Experience & Projects
### MedIL ‑ Medical images from Implicit Latent spaces University of Virginia
**GRADUATE RESEARCH ASSiSTANT**
_2024 ‑ Present_
- A first‑of‑its‑kind autoencoder that encodes medical images at their native resolution, without resampling, using implicit neural representations.
- Used alongside diffusion generative models to generate medical images of any resolution.
- Demonstrated exceptional or competitive performance versus previous methods on both T1w brain MRIs and lung CTs.

### Diffusion MRI features for predicting progression of multiple sclerosis University of Virginia
**GRADUATE RESEARCH ASSiSTANT** 
_2023 ‑ Present_
- Collaboration with Dr. Myla Goldman M.D. at Virginia Commonwealth University Department of Neurology.
- Studied image features in MS patient diffusion MRIs that correspond with progression or non‑progression of MS symptoms.
- Found that extra‑cellular content in MS lesions corresponds to patient performance in a six minute walk diagnostic test.

### FENRI ‑ Fiber orientations from Explicit Neural RepresentatIons University of Virginia
**GRADUATE RESEARCH ASSiSTANT** 
_2023 ‑ Present_
- A novel spatially‑continuous super‑resolution neural network to improve white matter tractography in clinical‑grade diffusion MRIs.
- Outperforms current methods in resolution enhancement of in vivo noisy, low‑resolution diffusion MRIs.
- Beats other methods at recovering white matter tracts from low‑resolution simulated diffusion images.
